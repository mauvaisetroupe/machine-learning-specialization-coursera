In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

 - Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
 - Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
 - Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
